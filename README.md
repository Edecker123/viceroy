this is a web time management app that is themed around the butterfly effect. The design is supposed to have a sleek futurisitic look letting your brain put the image togeher. This is what led to the lack of borders and minimalistic design. 

The motivation behind this project is the idea of how cluttered time management apps can be. The goal is to make building a timeline easy and seemless.

The way we go about this si by abstracting the abundance of options. The way we preserve custimization and control is through a seemless setting.
